num1 = int(input("Enter First Number: ")) #asks for First number
num2 = int(input("Enter Second Number: ")) #ask user for Second number

sum = num1+num2 #adds First and second number, stores it in sum

print('Sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))
#print(f'Sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum}') also works same as above
